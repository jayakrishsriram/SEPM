<body><h1>Budgeting</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Creating a budget is the first step towards achieving your financial goals. It helps you track your expenses, prioritize your spending, and save money for the things that matter most. Here are some tips for creating a budget:

Start by tracking your expenses for a month to get a sense of where your money is going.<br>
Categorize your expenses into fixed (e.g. rent, utilities) and variable (e.g. groceries, entertainment) expenses.
Set goals for each category based on your income and priorities.<br>
Use budgeting apps or spreadsheets to help you track your expenses and stick to your budget.<br>
budget is a plan for how you intend to spend your money during
the coming month, months, or year. It is an integrated statement based
on details of your income statement and balance sheet for the past month,
months, or year and a reflection of your financial goals. It expresses what you
would like to achieve in terms of spending and savings in the future.
A budget can assist you in determining whether:

<section style="font-size: 20px;">Your current spending patterns are satisfactory </section>
<section style="font-size: 20px;">You are saving and investing sufficient amounts to satisfy your financial goals</section>
<section style="font-size: 20px;">You need to make changes in order to satisfy your financial goals.</section>
A budget can be drawn up in six easy steps:
1. Estimate your future net income for the period of the budget.
2. Determine your expected expenditures during the period of the
budget.
3. Determine what you expect to spend to fund your personal goals.
4. Determine whether there is a surplus or a deficit.
5. Record your actual income and expenditures.
6. Evaluate whether changes in spending and saving are necessary </p>
